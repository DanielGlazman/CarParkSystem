# Car Park System - Parking Network Project

## A system for managing parking lots, staff, customers, orders and memberships for an automatic parking lot chain

- Signing up as registered customers 
- Logging in to their accounts
- Creating an order for a specific parking lot 
- Creating a membership for a one parking lot or for the entire chain 
- Filing a complaint
- View all their details (orders, memberships, complaints) in an interactive GUI and managing them (canceling, modifying)

- They have an interactive map of allparking slots in the lot with which they can check and midify the state of certain slots
- Managers can change prices of verious sevices awaiting the approval of the CEO
- Customer Service workers can view complaints, handle them and compensate client's account if they see fit
- Managers can request and view statistics and reports
