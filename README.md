# Car Park System - Parking Network Project

## A system for managing parking lots, staff, customers, orders and memberships for an automatic parking lot chain

In this project we, a group of 5 members, planned, designed and implemented a client-server desktop app for an automatic parking lot chain including GUIs for customers and staff. 

**_Customers' functionalities are:_**
- Entering and leaving a parking lot through the interface and charging
- Signing up as registered customers 
- Logging in to their accounts
- Creating an order for a specific parking lot 
- Creating a membership for a one parking lot or for the entire chain 
- Filing a complaint
- View all their details (orders, memberships, complaints) in an interactive GUI and managing them (canceling, modifying)

**_Some of the staff's functionalities are:_**
- They have an interactive map of allparking slots in the lot with which they can check and midify the state of certain slots
- Managers can change prices of verious sevices awaiting the approval of the CEO
- Customer Service workers can view complaints, handle them and compensate client's account if they see fit
- Managers can request and view statistics and reports


## Implemenatation Details:
- The project is written in Java using OCSF
