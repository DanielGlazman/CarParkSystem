# Car Park System - Parking Network Project

## A system for managing parking lots, staff, customers, orders and memberships for an automatic parking lot chain

In this project we, a group of 4 members, planned, designed and implemented a client-server desktop app for an automatic parking lot chain including GUIs for customers and staff. 

## Project's Structure:
**Client** - the client is built using JavaFX and OCSF. We use EventBus in order to pass events between classes.<br />
**Server** - the server is built using OCSF. All the communication to the MySql DB occurs by the server.<br />
**Entities** - shared module where all the entities of the project live.

- The project is written in Java using OCSF
- Hibernate ORM with MySQL
- An event-driven UI using JavaFX
- Maven as a dependency tool


## Running:
- Run Maven install in the parent project.
- Run the server using the exec:java goal in the server module.
- Run the client using the javafx:run goal in the client module.

## Functionalities:
**_Customers' functionalities are:_**
- Entering and leaving a parking lot through the interface and charging
- Signing up as registered customers 
- Logging in to their accounts
- Creating an order for a specific parking lot 
- Creating a membership for a one parking lot or for the entire chain 
- Filing a complaint
- View all their details (orders, memberships, complaints) in an interactive GUI and managing them (canceling, modifying)

**_Some of the staff's functionalities are:_**
- They have an interactive map of allparking slots in the lot with which they can check and midify the state of certain slots
- Managers can change prices of verious sevices awaiting the approval of the CEO
- Customer Service workers can view complaints, handle them and compensate client's account if they see fit
- Managers can request and view statistics and reports

For planning and designing the software we made UC, sequence and activity diagrams using *UML*.
